        <h1>Project Idea - Food Expiration App</h1> 

        <h2 style="font-size:24px;">Overview</h2>
        <p class="big">An expiration food date app, tells you when your food is nearly expired/already expired.
            The user must install a camera/scanner on the inside their fridge/pantry so that food can be scanned and show up on an mobile (iOS & Android) application for the user to see.
            Users can then be reminded of when different food is about to go bad. They may also be able to specify what they should buy when grocery shopping with a shopping list feature. 


        </p1>
        <h2 style="font-size:24px;">Description</h2>
<p class="big">
    This is a mobile app that will be available on mobile platforms such as Android and iOS.
    This app is linked to a product that’s sold separately. This item is a gadget that the consumer must attach to a convenient place such as their fridge or pantry. This gadget is made up of a screen and small camera which acts as a scanner. 
    To make is straightforward for the users, the food items will be labelled with a green icon if there’s enough time to safely consume the food. The items that are soon to expire (less than two days to expiration) will be labelled with yellow and the items that have passed the expiration date will be labelled in red. The app will check the ingredients the user currently owns and will recommended recipes from a database of pre-entered recipes. 
    For example, if the user gets a notification saying bananas are close to expiration, it will send you a recipe calling for ripe bananas. 
  </p1>
<h2 style="font-size:24px;">Main Features</h2>
<p class="big">

    <li>Shows expiry dates of food products and offers safety storage info by barcode scanning</li>
    <li>Prioritises the food that one should cook by their expiry dates and offer possible recipes</li>
    <li>Recognises commonly bought items and offer coupons and discounts suggestions (particular grocery stores for the user)</li>
    <li>Push notifications and informs the user of the expiry dates (reminders to calendars)</li>
    <li>Sorts out food into categories (baked goods, meat) as well as designs meal plans for (Breakfast, lunch and dinner)</li>
    <li>Create a shopping list for groceries - Recommendations of what to purchase based on history and coupons</li>
    
</p1>
<h2 style="font-size:24px;">Benefits to Society</h2>
<p class="big">
  The Expiration Date App elicits a healthy and balanced lifestyle by encouraging the user to keep track of their ingredients and by offering recipes to create at home. People can often find themselves resorting to ordering delivery or going outside to eat, spending an obscene amount of money over a long period of time. However, the Expiration Date App may motivate users to learn how to prepare their own food through provided recipes. Thus, the app may become the catalyst for many people learning a new skill that could potentially benefit the multitude of people around them.   

  One of the primary reason of household food waste is fresh produce left unattended in the freezer or fridge and people not completing their meals.<i> "Australian households throw away 2.5 million tonnes of edible food each year – that equates to nearly 300 kilograms per person!".</i> Thus, the app will also help minimise food wastage and better improve the environment by reducing CO2 production.
</p1>

<h2 style="font-size:24px;">Conclusion</h2>
<p class="big">
    Overall, this app will draw attention on educating consumers regarding quality and safety of food products. With reminder and shopping lists, the users will be able to purchase more appropriate quantities, instead of buying huge quantities of foods that may go bad. Furthermore, this will significantly help in controlling the waste that comes from every household which results in the reduction in food waste in the country.
