<h1>Group Feedback</h1>

<h2>Steven</h2> 

<h3>Jenny</h3>

<p>She helped the group a lot with organisation especially with scheduling and rescheduling group meetings to reasonable time that suited everyone. She was very quick to be organised and invited the group to a Google Doc early into the assignment.  Often during group meetings she would help bring back the group to communicate after a silent period of working to see how we all progressed.  She did a great job with the Industry Data section by using Burning Glass. </p>


<br><h3>Chamal</h3>
<p>He displayed good leadership throughout the assignment. Especially during the early stages, he would set small deadlines for the group so that we were always progressing in our work. Through this he demonstrated good communication skills with the group. He moved us forward in using GitHub and always checked up each individual member whenever certain things were required. He always tries to make himself available and is incredibly helpful when asking for help. </p>


<br><h3>Jeremy</h3>
<p>He was often outspoken and direct when communicating ideas to the group. His suggestions were clear to understand, making it very easy to work with him.  His contributions were core to the website and assessment which in turn is highly appreciated. He always made sure that we were on track with our work as a group. For instance, filling in the agenda at the end of each meeting helped the group assess what has been accomplished and what still needed to be done. He would also sometimes add extra information to other people's work as a helpful gesture. </p>

<br><h3>Momitha</h3>
<p>She communicated well with the lecturers. If we had a question as a group that we couldn't answer for a while, she would often send an email to one of the lecturers to help bring clarity to a certain issue. She contributed significantly to the assignment work and communicated well with others during group meetings. </p>




<br><br><h2>Jenny</h2> 

<h3>Steven</h3>
<p>He has been constantly working well to communicate with the team whenever a problem has arised. Despite being busy with uni and working, he has displayed great initiative in completing tasks to stay up to date with the rest of the group, even if he is unable to attend a meeting. </p>

<br><h3>Jeremy</h3>
<p>His work within the group was done quite well, he brought in his mum, an IT professional, to come help us with our interviewing process. He worked on a lot of the technical side of our assignment in terms of putting together our website and helping us out where he could. His leadership was shown when he helped us get on track to putting together our website to make it look and function well.</p>

<br><h3>Chamal</h3>
<p>His leadership was of great use in our group as at first we were all very quiet. He would speak up in meetings to make sure we were on track and would explain to any one of us how something worked if we did not understand. </p>

<br><h3>Momitha</h3>
<p>Although quiet in meetings, she produced great work in her writing. She worked well in writing up her research and helped out in any other areas she could to elaborate our descriptions. She communicated well with asking questions for our team whenever we were stuck on a particular section. </p>






<br><br><h2>Momitha</h2> 

<h3>Steven</h3>
<p>Steven balanced his personal and work schedule well and contributed thoroughly in the assignment. He was keeping up-to-date in every meeting and showed responsibility in finishing his tasks to a high standard. He helped us write some parts where we were unsure and communicated quite with the group.  </p>

<br><h3>Jenny</h3>
<p>Jenny organised our meetings and ensured everyone is on track throughout the group meetings. She has completed her task to a great level and communicated very well until the end of our assignment. She asked questions if she was unsure and got it clarified. She also recorded the responses for the interview. </p>

<br><h3>Chamal</h3>
<p>Chamal communicated effectively with all the group members in sorting our tasks to do and his leadership was shown in making certain that we are all on the same page. He has done good research in IT technologies and managed to ask everyone their opinions regarding the assignment. </p>

<br><h3>Jeremy:</h3>
<p>Jeremy contributed tremendously to our group in terms of designing of the website. He proofread some of the parts written by the rest of the group members to maintain the consistency. Also, he made it possible to interview an IT professional to get sense of what data engineers do. He communicated well with the group members and kept us on track in writing the agendas. </p>


  

<br><br><h2>Chamal</h2> 

<h3>Jenny</h3>
<p>Jenny was a main driving force behind our project, organising meetings, setting up this google docs and putting us on the right path were some of the things she did. She is a fast responder with almost instantaneous replies to any inquiry we had. She also completed her all her work which was given to her in good time too. She is an excellent communicator as well.  </p>

<br><h3>Jeremy</h3>
<p>Jeremy was a massive help throughout the project. His familiarity with IT helped a great ton in getting what was needed to be done. He also instantly agreed to bring his mother, who is an IT professional, without any hesitation to complete the Industry Data requirement. He contributed a lot and did his share of work with no issues. </p>

<br><h3>Steven</h3>
<p>Steven's contribution to the project was immense. He managed to do most of his work ahead of time while also working at his job. He never used work as an excuse to get out of work. In fact, it seemed that he was more than happy to accept more work. He is an enthusiastic personality who never kept to himself when we needed his assistance. </p>

<br><h3>Momitha</h3>
<p>Momitha is a silent worker. However, this was never a bad thing. She went above and beyond when completing her share of work and never hesitated to take any unfinished work for her to complete. Her knowledge in the field helped tremendously especially in the IT Technologies part. Though she prefers to work quietly, she never hesitated to clarify something or assist whenever an issue arose. </p>



  

<br><br><h2>Jeremy</h2> 

<h3>Jenny</h3>
<p>Great amount of effort, leadership and work from Jenny. She organized the meetings; making sure when we were available, set up the chat room and a Google Docs where we can all collaborate and edit our assignment works at the same time. She completed the majority of Industry Data and typed IT Work all on her own. Also, she communicated well with the group members and responded to any problems we faced almost instantaneously.  </p>

<br><h3>Chamal</h3>
<p>Chamal had shown great leadership by organizing the GitHub page and making sure everything was going well during the meeting. He communicated well with the group members and made sure everything had been done well. When any of us had any problems or was unsure of how to do the assignment work such as setting up the website, he took the role of aiding us voluntarily. Sometimes he even went to communicate and get help from the tutor.</p>

<br><h3>Steven</h3>
<p>Despite being busy from work and from other university courses, his time management was done very well. When he was unable to attend a meeting, he communicated to other group members and did the work ahead of schedule, even sometimes doing 80% of the work. Also, Steven contributed a lot from his assignment work, sometimes when we were unsure about something, he had helped us. </p>

<br><h3>Momitha</h3>
<p>She was sometimes quiet during the meetings, however she contributed tremendously to the assignment works. She did more than what was required and exceeded the group's expectations. When she had any problems or when she needed clarifications, she communicated very well to the group members and ensured that she understood everything. </p>
