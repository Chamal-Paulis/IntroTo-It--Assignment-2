<br>
<p>Hello! My name is Jeremy Ng Kwik Tung. I am currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT.<br><br>My student number is s3842858. I was born in Mauritius but came here to Australia in 2011 to get better access to education and to have a better life.<br> <br>I can also speak three languages which are French, English and Creole. For my hobbies, I love travelling, learning new things and playing video games. As of right now, I do not have a specific interest in Information Technology but I have some interest in programming.<br><br> As for my IT experience, I have a bit of experience in game design and programming, though I am a beginner in both sides. In terms of programming language, I have used Java, Visual Basic and Python before but I still have a lot more to learn.
</p>

<p>Hi my name is Jenny Nguyen (pronounced 'new wen'), s3838780, I am a first-year student at RMIT studying a Bachelor of Information Technology. <br> <br>My parents are from Vietnam however I was born here in Australia. My hobbies include watching too much kdrama/anime and playing Animal Crossing when I'm not meant to. <br><br>My interest in IT stems from an interest in gaming and with new technology helping people every day. The IT experience I have includes taking Information Technology as an elective during years 9-10, where I learnt to make flash games. I was also undertaking Computing and Informatics during VCE. I have worked in Microsoft Access, Visual Basic and created websites during these years. When it comes to programming, I have used HTML, CSS and Java, though I am a newbie to all of these.

<p >Momitha Yepuri (S3856512)<br><br>  Hello, I am originally from India but moved to New Zealand when I was 13 years old. I finished high school in 2019 at Westlake Girls High School, NZ. I am a trilingual for now. I speak Telugu, Hindi and English. I have started learning French online purely out of boredom from speaking native languages. I dance and have a love affair with my camera as well.<br><br> My father took the responsibility of educating me in every aspect of life possible and therefore enlightened me about the future of IT. I always see a spark in his eyes when he speaks about technology and innovation. This grew on me strongly and decided to walk his path. Fast forward to 3 years, I gained a job in high school as a ‘tech Wizard’ where I help students to make their digital lives better and error-free. My time spent there was extremely precious since I have developed knowledge in dealing with people and their server/password/printer issues. Also, reading tech magazines was such a thrill. <br><br>Anyway, I truly found that innovation changes the world by making it an increasingly edified spot to live. What's great, it makes self-instruction simpler, one can take in anything from anyplace.<br><br> I cannot wait to learn and explore my time at RMIT.  
</p>

<p >  Hi there! My name is Domingu Vithange Chamal Adithya Paulis, but I mainly use Chamal as my first name. I was born and raised in Sri Lanka. I moved to Melbourne at the start of 2020 to do my Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I am proficient in Sinhalese (my mother tongue) as well as English.<br><br> My hobbies include playing video games, baking, watching anime and strumming on my ukulele.<br><br> I have a big interest in game development and cybersecurity. I have been interacting with computers from a young age, so I grew quite an interest in technology as a whole. I have done various IT courses such as learning java, python and HTML. However, I am not a professional in any of these languages.  </blockquote>

<br>
<p s>Name:  Anh Kiet-Steven Pham.<br><br> Email s3815557@students.rmit.edu.au.<br><br> Both my parents are from Vietnam but was I born here in Melbourne. I enjoy relaxing and listening to music in my spare time. Occasionally, I talk to my friends online and play games with them.<br><br> My interest in IT began through observing and interacting with the IT department at my high school. Whenever my teachers and I had technical problems with our devices, we would contact the IT department to help troubleshoot our problems. I found that when looking around their workplace, there would always be complex-looking machines that would make me curious in their work.<br><br> I have only a little bit of experience in Java, AWS, and HTML so I still have a lot to learn

<br>
<h3 style="text-align:center; ">Team Profile </h3>

<p  ><strong>Jeremy Tung</strong><br><br> My results for the Myers-Briggs test were that I embodied; ENFJ The Teacher; ENTJ The Commander and ENFP The Champion. But in two of my tests, Myers-Briggs and 16-Personality, my top five strengths were responsibility, compassion, altruistic, charismatic and reliable. This tells me that I enjoy working and being with others and that I have the personality of wanting to teach and lead people. On the other hand, my top five weaknesses were that I am overly idealistic, too selfless, too sensitive, fluctuating self-esteem and struggle to make tough decisions. My weaknesses tell me that I look out too much for others than myself. However, in my learning style, I found that I am more of a visual learner meaning I like to visualise things in my mind or get a good picture of something. Nevertheless, my results were; 30% auditory, 55% visual and 15% tactile.
</p>
<br>
<p ><strong>Jenny Nguyen</strong><br> <br> For the Myer Briggs test, my results came back as ESFP-T. This classes me in the 'Entertainer' (turbulent) category in the 16 personality test. For one of my other tests, the learning styles one, I am 40% auditory, 35% visual and 25% tactile. This means that I learn better by hearing and listening, it's easier for me to understand and remember things that I have heard. In the Big Five test, my results were 60% Openness, 65% Conscientiousness, 48% extraversion and 67% neuroticism. These say how open I am to new ideas and experiences, how goal oriented and persistent I am, how much energy I take in from my environment, how much I value someone else's interests above mine and how sensitive I am towards stress and negative emotional triggers.
</p>
<br>
<p ><strong>Momitha Yepuri</strong><br> <br>The Myers-Briggs test result concluded that I have the personality of an INFP-T (Turbulent Mediator). It explains I am led by my emotions and quite self-reserved. One statement that can be appreciated is that I am not a person particularly driven by money or career status but that aligns with my values. Secondly, the Learning Style test gave the result that I am 70% of a visual learner. 20% of an auditory learner and 10% of a kinaesthetic learner. I like to imagine and see mental images to remember information. Finally, for the Creativity test, I obtained a score of 72.86, which comes under the section of being “very creative”. I now have an idea of how it is measured but still, I don't entirely trust nor am I satisfied with their way of testing. Creativity is subjective. These results remind and provide me with an understanding of what I am capable of, my strengths and weaknesses. Also, My workplace habits. Character defines us and how we interact with the world. In a workplace, it influences how we approach errands, settle on choices and oversee pressure. This character profiling makes me aware of my behaviour and progressively be mindful of others' regular inclinations and conduct styles. These tests might guide me to understand other personalities in a team and how I can mould according to the team to avoid unnecessary conflict. Overall, I know what I am composed of, the personality test has not revealed any major shocks. Thus, I and hesitant to infer that these tests will influence my behaviour in a team.  
</p>
<br>
<p  ><strong>Chamal Paulis</strong><br><br>The Myers-Briggs personality test concluded that I have the personality of a Mediator.<br><br> The Learning Style test determined that I am a "tactile" learner.  I learn better when there are physical activities involved. It also determines that I have difficulty staying still in one place. The Big Five Personality Test determines my personality through five major factors. The test displays that I am in the middle when it comes to openness. According to the test openness describes the person's ability to think abstract and in more complex ways. The test determines that I am more likely to be impulsive and easily sidetracked. The test also showcases that I am not exactly a person who wishes to seek social stimulation or rewards. According to this test, I experience a lot of empathy and enjoy taking care of others while being trusting and forgiving. Lastly, this test determines that I am less prone to negative emotions than others. These tests certainly helped me to understand my position and stance in team activities. Though they show that I am willing to help and support, my introverted aspect might put a hindrance to my work in group activities. However, these tests have not exactly revealed any shocking facts about myself, so I doubt they have really influenced my behaviour.
</p>
<br>
<p  ><strong>Stevan Pham</strong><br><br>Myer-Briggs test<br>According to the test my personality type is of a Mediator (INFP-T). <br>78% Introverted <br>52% Intuitive<br>60% Feeling<br>72% Prospecting<br>75% Turbulent <br><br>Personality test<br>77% Openness <br>40% Extraversion<br>77% Agreeableness<br><br>Learning style test<br>20% Auditory <br>50% Visual<br>30% Tactile<br><br> Overall, the results of the tests accurately conclude that I’m more of an introvert than I am an extrovert. Although through personal experience, in most situations I find myself able to communicate and exchange my ideas with others in my team quite easily as long as I’m confident in what I am saying. Given my team are agreeable, open, and are generally nice people I would simply find it a normal part of my day to communicate my thoughts with them. I find that when I'm working with people who are focused in the right environment, it helps me significantly to stay on track with what I need to do. I believe that I’m quite agreeable and open to the ideas of others. Although it is implied that I’m more of a visual learner, I’m willing to have it almost any other way if it is more comfortable for my team.

<h3 style="text-align:center">Ideal Jobs </h3>
<br>

<p ><strong>Jeremy</strong><br><br>As of now, I do not have an ideal job that I want to aim solely towards but when scrolling through the job advertisements, I found that I am interested in being a software engineer. What interests me for this job position is the salary but also the key responsibilities where you have to work with other departments of the company to find both business and technical solutions to problems. You would also be building new software, learning new things and teaching others which I enjoy doing.<br> <br>However, I would also be interested in working for a company that values reliability, quality of work & delivering what they promise. Also, I do not mind working as a leader or as a group member. 
</p>
<br>
<p ><strong>Jenny</strong><br><br>My ideal job is a job in I.T. There isn't a particular job out there that I want to do as of right now, but I do know that I want to head towards artificial intelligence and cyber security, probably as either a systems/software engineer. After completing my bachelor course, I would like to undertake an undergrad program into a job that I like, I wouldn’t mind if it were overseas. Part of the reason is because I know that it will be a safe investment on my future to head that way, but a bigger part is my interest in it. I have always been fascinated with the idea of working with AI, everything is so new and impressive. Many people fear what AI can be, but to me I think it is something worth delving deeply into, to find out more about it. AI can help the future grow and help us advance further than we have ever yet. With this, I would like to be part of a team where I can help develop new technologies and create a secure product for the public.
</p>
<br>
<p ><strong>Momitha:</strong><br><br>I am seeking to turn into a data scientist after my undergrad. The most fascinating thing about Data science is it feels like a factual investigation. Having the option to acquire, procedure, and manufacture models out of information, which will eventually be utilized for their prescient abilities - be it for human services, targeted advertising, Advanced AI /Augmented reality – it's energizing in my view. By investigating, obtaining and assorting raw data helps improve how people settle on choices and how calculations upgrade results. I think it's fascinating to be able to build models that enhance the existing models and create the best UI experiences. The overall makeup of the job advert is incredibly attractive as they straight-forwardly mention what they require of you. No unnecessary wishes. The tasks they have mentioned, such as “predict the future performance of tasks, users, and products. Quality assessment of ML models and fraud detection”. This is the work that I want to be doing after 5 years.
</p>
<br>
<p  ><strong>Chamal:</strong> <br><br>I don’t have an ideal job I’m pursuing at the moment. However, I want to work both in the professional and academic fields in IT. I’d like to start my career as an entry level programmer, presumably developing an utility application. Then I would like to work in cyber-security. Perhaps as a cyber security consultant. 
</p> 
<br>


<p ><strong>Steven</strong><br><br>I have yet to have a clear depiction of what I consider an ideal job. Though, in the long run, I would say that I’d be interested in working with a team. I enjoy having to interact with other people in order to work towards a goal. And rather than doing things by myself, working alongside others will support me in honing and expanding my knowledge and skills. I imagine myself hopefully working with bright and like-minded inpiduals within a company will integrity and righteous values. When scrolling through job advertisements, one thing that piqued my interest was a web development job that required working with others. However, I realise that I may need some experience beforehand. Perhaps an internship or undergrad program will help in gaining experience.
</p>
<br>

<h4 style="text-aling:center">When we were discussing about our ideal jobs, we came across some common elements amongst each other's job.</h4>

<p > - Most of us have yet to develop a clear future career in our minds, while some have a good general idea. <br><br> - If planning on working for a company, some of us would like to work for one with clear values. For example, most people would like to work for a company that puts emphasis on the quality of work, integrity, security, and consistency. <br> <br> - We’ve considered undergraduate programs and internships in order to build up experience.
</p>
<br>
<p> There are quite a number of people would move overseas to advance their career. This was the only different factor that we came across. 
 <br>
<h4 style="text-aling:center">We came across some similarities as well differences in our career plans. </h4>

<p >Something similar with our entire group is that we would like to all gain new experiences through various outlets, such as internships and other programs, to help us grow as people and to be able to utilise our opportunities not just right after uni but also in future. We may not all stay in the same job forever, most of us won’t. Differences include the actual job itself, though many of us have described our ‘ideal job’ to be something we aren’t too sure about, our descriptions of the jobs we want are all different.
